# python

This repository contains code samples for 2 different Python scripts. The 1st sample contains a script that reads a text file containing newline-separated image URLs and submits the URLs to an image-processing API endpoint. The 2nd sample contains a pair of scripts. The first script parses an Excel worksheet and loads the parsed contents into a database. The second script enables users to perform full-text search of the database for the parsed contents of the Excel worksheet.
